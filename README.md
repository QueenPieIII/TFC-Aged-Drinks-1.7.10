# TFC Aged Drinks 1.7.10
> This mod is a recreation of the [TFC Aged Drinks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfc-aged-drinks "TFC Aged Drinks") mod for **TerraFirmaCraft: The Next Generation**! If you are looking for the official repository of the **TFC: TNG** version then this is not the place.

This mod adds aged drink variants to TerraFirmaCraft which can offer various effects!

## Setup
Make sure you are using **Java 8**. If you want to specify a specific version then edit line 10 in the ./gradlew file

`export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/jdk`
*Unix only. For windows, edit the JAVA_HOME enviroment variable with your desired path and use the gradlew.bat file*

You will also need a custom **ForgeGradle** jar to prevent your tasks from failing. The reason why this happens is because the tasks are trying to acces an endpoint which is not available anymore

------------

Thanks to **Lumintorious** for making the original [TFC Aged Drinks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfc-aged-drinks "TFC Aged Drinks") mod
