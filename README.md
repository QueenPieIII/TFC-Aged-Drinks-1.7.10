# TFC Aged Drinks 1.7.10
> This is a recreation of the [TFC Aged Drinks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfc-aged-drinks "TFC Aged Drinks") mod! If you are looking for the official repository of the  for **TerraFirmaCraft: The Next Generation** version then this is not the place.

EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW IS A MESS! WILL FIX IT LATER!!!!
THIS IS ALSO MY FIRST MOD AND FIRST TIME USING JAVA!!

This mod adds aged drink variants to TerraFirmaCraft which can offer various effects!

To age drinks, you will have to fill up a barrel with the preferred alcoholic beverage of your choice and add some sugar.
After that, seal the barrel and wait 3 months!

_0.002 - 0.006 oz of sugar per mB_\
_20 - 60 oz of sugar per 10 B_

## Setup
Make sure you are using **Java 8**. If you want to specify a specific version then edit line 10 in the ./gradlew file\
`export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/jdk` *Unix only.\
For windows, edit the JAVA_HOME enviroment variable with your desired path and use the gradlew.bat file*

You will also need a custom **ForgeGradle** jar to prevent your tasks from failing. The reason why this happens is because the tasks are trying to acces an endpoint which is not available anymore
